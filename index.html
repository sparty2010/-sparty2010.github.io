    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Josh's Programming Webpage</p>
    <p>This website will be evidence of my journey as I confront my fear of software. It is a skill that I believe will be higly valuable for the forseeable future. Over the course of the semester I will develop javascripts that will be available through my site. A short bio of myself will also be available. I look forward to building a foundation in computer science over the course of the semester.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting. To learn more about me <a href="aboutme.html">click here.</a></p>
